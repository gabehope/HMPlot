# Polygon

Filled polygons from their vertices in order, one per series.

## Example

```python
import hmplot as hm

data = {
    "x": [0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 5, 4],
    "y": [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2],
    "shape": ["a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b", "b"],
}
with hm.Plot(data=data, height=300, axes2d=True) as plot:
    hm.Polygon(x="x", y="y", series="shape")
plot
```

## Options

Keywords are snake_case.

### Options

- `data` (`table`): A table for this mark alone: a mark with data displays on its own, in a Plot of its own.

### Position

- `x` (`column`): Each vertex's x position, one row per vertex. Leave x and y out inside Contour (bands), Voronoi or Hull: Polygon then draws the shapes they make.
- `y` (`column`): Each vertex's y position, one row per vertex.

### Appearance

- `fill` (`channel`): The fill color: a CSS color, or a column mapped to colors (each polygon takes its first row's value). Default: `"#547ba2"`.
- `opacity` (`channel`): The opacity, 0 to 1: a number, or a column (categories map through opacity_scale). Default: `1`.
- `outline_color` (`channel`): The outline's color: a CSS color, or a column of categories mapped through outline_color_scale. Default: `"#ffffff"`.
- `outline_opacity` (`channel`): Border opacity from 0 to 1: a number, numeric column, array or expression. Fades the border over the fill; mark opacity still applies to both. Missing values hide the border. Default: `1`.
- `outline_width` (`channel`): The outline's width in CSS pixels, drawn inside the mark's edge (a point's at most its radius). Default: `0`.

### Scales

- `fill_scale` (`scale`): The fill's scale, which marks can share: continuous({domain, colormap, transform}) for numbers, categorical({domain, range}) or ordinal() for categories.
- `colormap` (`string | color[] | object`): The colormap of a numeric fill or color: a name, a list of colors, or {colors, space, positions}. Default: the theme's (Viridis).
- `outline_color_scale` (`scale`): A categorical() scale from the outline_color column's categories to colors.
- `opacity_scale` (`scale`): A categorical() scale from the opacity column's categories to opacities, 0 to 1.

### Display

- `label` (`string`): The mark's name in the legend and the settings pane.
- `legend` (`boolean`): Whether the mark has a legend entry. Default: `True`.
- `visible` (`boolean`): Whether the mark is drawn. Default: `True`.
- `domains` (`boolean`): Whether the mark's data counts toward its axes' automatic domains; false leaves them to the other marks (a reference line, a decorative part). Default: `True`.
- `blend` (`"normal" | "additive" | "multiply" | "screen" | "subtractive"`): How the mark mixes with what is drawn under it; any mode but normal draws it transparent, and SVG and PDF exports draw additive and subtractive as an image. Default: `"normal"`.
- `glow` (`number`): How much the mark glows: its own color times glow blooms around it in the plot's presentation (0 does not glow); the Plot's bloom effect sets the bloom's strength and radius. SVG and PDF exports draw the whole plot as an image. Default: `0`.
- `shade` (`ShadeSpec`): A plugin's shade (registerPlugin): { kind, ...parameters }, as { kind: "hatch", spacing: 6 } (Python hm.shade("hatch", spacing=6)), recolors each fragment the mark draws; picking, tooltips, domains and legends are unchanged. SVG and PDF exports draw a shaded mark as an image.
- `options` (`string[]`): The settings the settings pane shows for this mark, by name.
- `name` (`string`): The mark's name in the settings pane, and the name facet.endpoint() and partition.endpoint() find it by.

### Interaction

- `identity` (`identity`): Whose rows these are for selections: an identity() shared by tables that show the same things. Default: its data's.
- `select` (`boolean | selection | object`): Click to replace the selection; an exact repeat clears it. Shift/Meta/Ctrl-click toggles membership (whole series for Line, Area): true uses its data's selection, or give a selection(). input("root").set("id") writes an input instead: a click sets it to the clicked row's id (a drill-down's root), .set(literal(v)) to a constant, .reset() to its default, and a click on nothing restores its default (input("root", {default}), else a Select of that name's, else null); several marks may write one input.
- `hover` (`boolean | selection | object`): Mark the row under the pointer as @hovered (a whole series for Line, Area), without fading the others: true uses its data's hover, or give a selection(). input("focus").set("series") writes an input instead: while the pointer is on a row the input shows its series (or .set(literal(v)), a constant), then its committed value again (a hover that would change this mark's own rows is an error).
- `tooltip` (`boolean | field[] | object`): Show the nearest row's values in a box by the pointer: true, a list of fields, or {fields, radius, content}. Default: the Plot's.
- `nearest` (`boolean | selection | object`): Mark the row a tooltip shows as @nearest, with or without the tooltip: under the pointer, else the nearest drawn row within radius pixels (a whole series for Line, Area): true, a selection(), or {selection, radius}. Default: the Plot's.
- `respond` (`boolean | "selected" | "brushed" | "hovered" | "nearby" | "nearest" | selection | array`): Which interaction states fade this mark's other rows to selection_opacity; "hovered" fades them while hovering, "nearest" while a row is nearest. Default: the states it sets, except hover and nearest.
- `selection_opacity` (`number`): The opacity of the rows outside the selection while one is active. Default: `0.25`.
- `enter_effect` (`boolean | "fade" | object`): How rows that arrive in a keyed update appear: "fade", or {effect, duration, easing}. animate()'s enter option is the value a channel starts from.
- `exit_effect` (`boolean | "fade" | object`): How rows that leave in a keyed update disappear, as enter_effect. animate()'s exit option is the value a channel ends at.

### Animation

- `animation` (`boolean`): Animate changes to the mark's values. Default: `False`.
- `animation_duration` (`number`): How long an animated change takes. Default: `300` ms.
- `animation_easing` (`"linear" | "quad-in" | "quad-out" | "quad-in-out" | "cubic-in" | "cubic-out" | "cubic-in-out" | "sine-in-out"`): The animation's easing. Default: `"cubic-in-out"`.

### Series

- `series` (`column`): Groups the rows into polygons, each group's rows its vertices in order; without it, all the rows are one polygon.

## Usage

Polygon fills polygons given as vertex rows: each group of `series` is a polygon, its rows its vertices in order, triangulated on the host with earcut. Inside Contour (bands), Voronoi or Hull, leave out `x` and `y`: it draws the triangles they make. `outlineColor` and `outlineWidth` outline the polygons' own edges.

Each polygon's triangles carry its first row, so a column fills it, and hovering or selecting it takes the whole polygon. For holes and multipolygons, use GeoJSON.

Polygon is a core primitive: import it from the package root. Chart templates such as DensityBands draw their filled shapes with it.

> **Vector, except** in a 3D view that holds a mark with no vector form there (Points3D, Surface or another 3D mark, a Heatmap or Image, a lit or additive mark, a globe or polar frame): then SVG and PDF exports draw all of that view's marks as one image, and `mode="vector"` refuses it. In other 3D views the polygons are vectors too, drawn back to front by depth (approximate where marks cross closely). A `fill` column of numbers or categories stays vector. See [what is not exported as vector](/HMPlot/docs/export.md).
